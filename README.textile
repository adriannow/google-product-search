h1. Google Product Search

This plugin provides a rake task for generating an xml feed for google product search.

rake googlebase:generate generates an xml file of your products.

h2. Configuration

To configure, add Rails.root/config/google_base.yml

Example google_base.yml file in files/google_base.yml


As the structure of the xml is dependant on your product models I have left it to the programmer to modify the google.rake file and set the correct instance methods for returning product information, along with the named_scope for returning live products.

TODO:

Instead of editing this rake file manually it would be good to add a plugin type class method which can take the configuration of your products and generate this automatically.
